How to throttle bandwidth in s3cmd
==================================

On Linux you can throttle bandwidth using the throttle command line program, e.g.

cat mybigfile | throttle -k 512 | s3cmd put - s3://mybucket/mybigfile 

which would limit reads from mybigfile to be 512kbps. 

Throttle is available by apt-get or yum in all the major Linux distributions.


Alternatively, the utility trickle can be used:

trickle -d 250 s3cmd get... would limit the download rate of s3cmd to 250 kilobytes per second.

trickle -u 250 s3cmd put... would limit the upload rate of s3cmd to 250 kilobytes per second.

Trickle is a yum or apt-get install if you're on a Fedora or Debian/Ubuntu machine. You must have the libevent library (Trickle's only dependency) already installed before you install Trickle. Most modern distribution will already have this installed.
On Windows, the throttle or trickle utilities are not available, but if you are using S3Express instead of s3cmd, you can limit max bandwidth simply by using the flag -maxb of the PUT command.

If you get: 
<<trickle: Could not reach trickled, working independently: No such file or directory>>
add -s to command line, for example:
trickle -s -u 350 s3cmd put file.omg s3://BUCKET
-s runs trickle in standalone mode independent of trickled.
